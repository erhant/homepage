It was unlike any other day that day, normal people going on with their normal lives.
...

World is taken over by hellish creatures. Humanity tries its best to defend itself, but to no avail. The creatures are unlike nothing one could imagine. Gigantic humanoid figures with pitch-black skin, appeared out of sea shores, decimating everything on their path as they roam the sea-side cities. Bugs with indestrucable shells flying into buildings, tearing a hole in them. Snake-like creatures feeding on whatever appeared in front of them.

What did they eat, how did they reproduce, why are they similar to earth creatures, how do they communicate? They need not be answered, as soon there would be no one to ask them. We did not know why this universe came to be, nor how; now we still do not know why it ends like this but we do know how.

The first thing that came to people's mind as they approached the restaurant was that how come no one had seen or heard anything about it? There were so many ancient gods, ancient stories and tales, theories and arguments about god and afterlife; and yet, a restaurant that awaits in the end was not thought of not even once? "How could
they know?" one thinks to themselves at that point. Nevertheless, this was the reality now. Not long ago you were waking up to have a breakfast and then off to your work, and back home. Now, there lays an entrance to a quite standard-looking restaurant.

There seemed to be only a single _employee_ in this restaurant. An old peculiar man, rather crumbled, and with very bright blue eyes. The skin of him darkened like a coal miner, making his unusually bright eyes even more capturing.
