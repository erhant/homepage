        A decentralized chatting application using smart contracts. Users address each other by their wallet addresses,
        but they can use aliases too. Each message is a transaction, which is logged as an EVM event to be queried by
        clients.

        A collection of mini-applications I made using Spotify Web API. You can see audio features of your currently
        playing track, compare playlists of two users, and find if a user has added a track in some playlist.

        During a 17-hour bus trip from Warsam to Talinn, I couldn't sleep in the bus so I thought of a problem to pass
        time. I then couldn't solve this problem, and wrote a paper about it; which this repository is about.{" "}

        As a form of recreational mathematics, I have been working on the Collatz Conjecture since late highschool. I
        made some small findings, mostly focusing on algebraic tools to study trajectories of numbers.{" "}

        Flashy Sort is a sorting algorithm I had written around my sophomore year, but turns out it is similar (and
        actually worse) than <Anchor href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashsort">Flash Sort</Anchor>. The idea is to
        find the minimum and maximum values in linear time, and then use interpolation to make a rough guess on where
        the other elements would be if the array were to be sorted.

        <Anchor href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/orca">Orca</Anchor>, which is a 2-dimensional esoteric programming
        language. I had some fun with it, such as creating a fretboard and tab-reader, or musical scale player with it.
        I am collecting such things in this repo!
