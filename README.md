# My Homepage

This is my homepage + blog, made with NextJS + TypeScript + Unified (Remark + Rehype) + MantineUI. The blog posts are generated from the Markdown files under [posts directory](./_posts/). Note that it supports subfolders there too, where it replaces the `/` characters in the path with `___` to generate a slug. This is done for grouping purposes on my side.

For icons, I use [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons-react.vercel.app/). For styling, I took some helps from [Omatsuri](https://omatsuri.app/) and [Smart-Swatch](https://smart-swatch.netlify.app/#fcfcfc). For fonts, I used [this](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) and [this](https://csslayout.io/).
