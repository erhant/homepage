# My Homepage

This is my homepage + blog, made with NextJS + TypeScript + SASS + Unified (Remark + Rehype) + MantineUI.

For icons, I use <https://tabler-icons.io/>.

For styling, see <https://omatsuri.app/page-dividers>

## Blog Posts

The blog supports recursive blog posts.

```text
_posts
  foo
    bar.md
    sup.md
    README.md
  something.md
  test.md
```

For example, the file structure above will cause each of the top level.
