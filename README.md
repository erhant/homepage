# My Homepage

This is my homepage + blog, made with NextJS + TypeScript + Unified (Remark + Rehype) + MantineUI.

## Blog Rendering

The blog posts are generated from the Markdown files. It supports subfolders, where `/` characters in the path are replaced with `___` to generate a slug. This is done for grouping purposes on my side. The markdown parser uses Unified with Remark and Rehype.

## Favicon

The favicon is just a `&` symbol in Courier Prime font. My name and surname initials make `et`, which is latin for `and`, and also where the `&` symbol comes from.
