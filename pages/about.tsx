            Hello! I am Erhan, a full-stack developer from Istanbul, Turkey. I build &amp; engineer computer software;
            driven by a thirst for knowledge and with respect to style, standards, security and scalability.

            I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Y&#x131;ld&#x131;z Technical University, and then I have
            recently obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science &amp; Engineering from Ko√ß University. Most of my study has
            been on the more theoretical computer science part, rather than development (e.g. mobile, devops). I really
            enjoy cryptography and theory of computation in particular. I am currently working as a self-employed
            full-stack developer in Macerita, a fresh startup! I plan on working more on the web3 side of things in
            future; as in the end I believe{" "}

            My tech-stack is TypeScript oriented, with NextJS for frontend and Node+Express for backend. As for Web3, I
            use Solidity mostly with EVM-compatible chains. I make use of component libraries on frontend, mostly
            MantineUI; though I may use SASS if need be. I enjoy following standards and clean-coding practices. I
            believe it is more valuable that the code is simple, yet generic enough; rather than complex and
            all-purpose.
