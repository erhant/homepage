                Hello! I am Erhan, a full-stack developer from Istanbul, Turkey. I build &amp; engineer computer
                software; driven by a thirst for knowledge and with respect to style, standards, security and
                scalability.

            I have obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Y&#x131;ld&#x131;z Technical University on February
            2019, and then I have recently obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science &amp; Engineering from Ko√ß University
            on February 2022. Most of my study has been on the more theoretical computer science part; I really enjoy
            cryptography and theory of computation in particular and I plan on working more on the Web3 in future!{" "}

            My tech-stack is TypeScript oriented, with NextJS for frontend and Node+Express for backend. As for Web3, I
            use Solidity. I make use of component libraries on frontend, mostly MantineUI; using Sass if need be. I
            enjoy following standards and clean-coding practices, valuing simple over complex.

            The favicon is just a &amp; symbol in Courier Prime font. My name and surname initials together make
            <kbd>&quot;et&quot;</kbd>, which is latin for <kbd>&quot;and&quot;</kbd>. This is where the &amp; symbol
            originates from, which I also think to be a cool symbol. I used to game a lot, maybe hit me up on Steam ‚ú®{" "}
