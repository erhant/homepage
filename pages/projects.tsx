        As my M.Sc. thesis, I worked on the optimization of Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication in NVIDIA GPUs. For

        that the accuracy is not affected too much but we still gain benefits from the reduced precisions. The methods
        were further extended to support multi-precision (both precisions are used per se, at different times).
