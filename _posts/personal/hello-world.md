# Hello World

I have finally made my own homepage! It was a beautiful experience to learn front-end, and most of the credit here goes to the awesome design of Mantine UI and <https://web.dev/learn/css/>.

The site is made with NextJS, and has a markdown parser for blog post generation. In doing so, it can highlight code:

```c
int main() {
  printf("Sounds good, right?");
}
```

as well as render maths:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
3x+1 & x \text{ odd} \\
\frac{x}{2} & x \text{ even}
\end{cases}
$$

I also have a tools section, which will have some lightweight tools of any kind (mostly done for my own entertainment or educational purposes).

Keep an eye out on this blog! I plan on writing math - programming - music related stuff here in the times to come.
