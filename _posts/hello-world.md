# Congruences

**Q:** Is 1234567 a square?
**A:** No, becuase the last digit is not possible to be 7 for square numbers. So we kind of look at the number in modulo 10.

$$
a \equiv b \mod m
$$

This notation is by **Gauss**, and it means that $a-b$ is divisible by $m$. In other words, $m \mid a-b$.

**Q:** Can you solve $1000003 = x^2 + y^2$?
**A:** You can realize that $x^2 \equiv 0,1 \mod 4$. Then $x^2 + y^2 \equiv (0,1) + (0,1) \equiv 0,1,2 \mod 4$. So, the number can not have 3 as the last digit, thus the equation does not have any integer solutions.

### Fermats Theorem

$$
x^p \equiv x \mod p \text{\hspace{4ex}($p$ prime)}
$$

$$
x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \text{\hspace{4ex}($x$ not divisible by $p$)}
$$

**Euler** also found that $x^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \mod m$ for $x,m$ coprime and $\phi(m) =$ number of integers less than an coprime to $m$.
_EX:_ $\phi(12) = |\{1, 5, 7, 12\}| = 4$

Suppose you want to test if $n$ is prime for very large $n$. We can check if $2^n \equiv 2 mod n$ (which can be done efficiently).

- If not, then $n$ is definitely not a prime.
- If yes, then we do not know, but it could be a prime.

For Diophantine equations, if $f(x,y,z) = 0$ then $f(x,y,z) \equiv 0 \mod m$. The reverse is not always true, and **Hasse Principle** describes that. If the latter turns out to be true for all $m$, then most likely $f(x,y,z) = 0$.

### Quadratic Residue

Can we solve $x^2 \equiv a \mod p$ (p prime)? Here, $a$ is the quadratic residue. **Legendre** symbol is a pretty useful notation about this:

$$
\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) =
\begin{cases}
	+1 & \text{if $a$ square$\bmod p$ and $a,p$ coprime} \\
	-1 & \text{if $a$ is not square$\bmod p$ and $a,p$ coprime} \\
	0 & \text{if $a$ is divisible by $p$}
\end{cases}
$$

### Quadratic Reciprocity

Euler found a relationship between $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)$ for $p,q$ odd primes.

- $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = 1$ if $x^2 = p + qy$ has an integer solution.
- $\left(\frac{q}{p}\right) = 1$ if $x^2 = q + py$ has an integer solution.

What Euler discovered is that:

- $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)$ if $q$ or $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$.
- $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) \not= \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)$ if $q$ and $p \equiv 3 \mod 4$ (and of course $p \not= q$.

This indicates that there is an amazing hidden structure in this seemingly unrelated equations. Such feeling will happen a lot in Number Theory :).

**Q:** Is 3 quadratic residue of 71?
**A:** This is asking if $\left(\frac{3}{71}\right) = 1$. We can check instead if $\left(\frac{71}{3}\right) = 1$. This is easy to find, as $71 \equiv 2 \mod 3$ and 2 is not a square, so $\left(\frac{71}{3}\right) = -1$.

# Additive Number Theory

**Goldbach Conjecture**: Is every even number a sum of 2 primes? Examples are $12 = 5 + 7$, $14 = 7 + 7$ and so on. The answer: we don't know! **Chen** managed to show that every even number is a sum of prime and a product of two primes ($p + qr$),

**Twin Prime Conjecture**: Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p+2$ is also prime? We don't know this too, but **Zhang** proved that $p$ and $p+k$ for k in the order of millions will always have a prime.

**Arithmetic Progressions**: Can you find arithmetic progressions of primes, such as $5, 11, 17, 23, 29, ...$.

Dirichlet has shown that for any arithmetic progression in the form $a + nb$ has infinitely many primes.

# Recreational Number Theory

**Perfect Numbers**: A perfect number is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. Example: $6 = 1 + 2 + 3$.

**Amicable Numbers**: Two numbers are amicable if the sum of their proper divisors give each other, such as 220 and 284.

**Collatz Conjecture**: Suppose you map $n \to 3n+1$ for odd $n$, and $n \to n/2$ for even $n$. Doing this repeatedly, do you always reach to 1 in the end for all $n$? We do not know yet!

**Sum of Digits**: Many examples are there for recrational mathematics concerning digit sums. For example, $370 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3$.

# Algebraic Number Theory

As an example of algebraic number, consider $m + ni$ for $i=\sqrt{-1}$. These are called **Gaussian Integers** and they have a unique factorization. For example, $5 = (2 + i)(2 - i) = 2^2 + 1^2$.

Notice that $m^2 + n^2 = (m + ni)(m - ni)$. Sum of squares turn out to be quite special.

Fermat has shown that a prime $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$ can be written as $p = m^2 + n^2$. Quite surprising.

# Combinatorial Number Theory

An example would be partitioning. $p(n)$ is the number of partitions that you can write $n$ as a sum of smaller integers.

$p(5) = 7$ because there are 7 different ways to write $5 = 4 + 1 = 3 + 2 = 3 + 1 + 1 = ...$.

It turns out that $p(5n + 4)$ is divisible by 5, for seemingly no reason at all.

Looking at the sum of:

$$
\sum p(n) q^n = 1 + q + 2q + 3q^3 + 5q^4 + 7q^5 + ...
$$

Euler discovered that this is equal to:

$$
\frac{1}{1-q}\times\frac{1}{1-q^2}\times\frac{1}{1-q^3}\times...
$$
