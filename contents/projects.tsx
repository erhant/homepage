        the other elements would be if the array were to be sorted.

        As my M.Sc. thesis, I worked on the optimization of Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication in NVIDIA GPUs. For
        this, I have researched ways of using mixed-precision (32-bit and 64-bit in particular) to my advantage, such
        that the accuracy is not affected too much but we still gain benefits from the reduced precisions. The methods
        were further extended to support multi-precision (both precisions are used per se, at different times).
