        As my M.Sc. thesis, I worked on the optimization of Sparse Matrix-Vector

        mixed-precision (32-bit and 64-bit in particular) to my advantage, such
        that the accuracy is not affected too much but we still gain benefits
        from the reduced precisions. The methods were further extended to
        support multi-precision where both precisions are used per se, at
        different times.
